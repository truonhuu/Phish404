# Phish404
This game is inspired by Google's offline "Jumping Dino" game. Instead of a dinosaur, the player controls a character that must jump to avoid incoming obstacles, represented as emails. In the real world, we receive hundreds of emails each month. While many are harmless, some are malicious, attempting to steal personal information or gain unauthorized access. The game serves as a reminder that no matter how careful we are, encountering phishing or scam emails is inevitable. That's why learning how to recognize and protect against phishing is crucial, not just for personal safety but also to help safeguard organizations. In the game, players will take on the role of a catphish and jump to avoid email-shaped and phone-shaped obstacles.
